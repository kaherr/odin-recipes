# odin-recipes

This is the first required project of **The Odin Project's** curriculum. This project was an introductory project that allowed us to practice what we have learned in the **HTML Foundations** section of the **Foundations Course**. The link to the course can be found [here] (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
