    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>15 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onions</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>3 cups tomato pasta sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles
        and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Then, drain the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        mushrooms, onions, and garlic and cook until onions are tender; drain
        excess liquid and cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, bring a small pot of water to a boil; add spinach and
        simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and cool slightly; squeeze out any excess
        liquid and finely chop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, egg, salt, oregano, basil, and
        pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cooled mushroom mixture and spinach; beat with an electric mixer on
        low speed for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>Lay 5 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/3 of the ricotta-spinach mixture over noodles, then sprinkle
        with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 cup pasta sauce over top. Repeat layers two more times, then
        cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
