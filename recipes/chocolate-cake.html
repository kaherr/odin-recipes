    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>18 ounces of chocolate</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees
        C). Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        Stir until completely dissolved; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in
        15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour
        chocolate into the bowl of an electric mixer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a time, into chocolate
        until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Beat in hot sugar water. Slowly beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
      <li>Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
      <li>
        Have a pan larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in the
        larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the
        sides of the cake pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The
        center will still look wet. Place cake in the refrigerator until
        thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for 10 seconds
        and invert onto a serving plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
